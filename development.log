- fixed date type mismatch in get_age()

/templates/content/js/com.cnprog.post.js:
- fixed bug with post deletion/recovery

javascript:
- changed to use of non-minified code - better for editing 
and debugging

/templates/question.html:
- fixed display of delete/undelete links

templates:
added comments in the beginning/end of each template
for the debugging purposes - so that you know which template outputs what html
<!-- user_favorites.html -->
<!-- end user_favorites.html -->
